# Razorpay Payment Gateway - React.js Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of the Razorpay payment gateway into a React.js frontend application. It allows users to make payments using Razorpay's secure and seamless payment system.

## Features

- **Frontend Payment Integration**: Simple and efficient React.js integration with Razorpay.
- **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for a modern and responsive payment interface.
- **Payment Validation**: Payment status is verified by the backend after a successful transaction.
  
## Prerequisites

Before starting with the Razorpay Payment Gateway React.js integration, make sure you have the following:

- A Razorpay account with access to the Razorpay API key and secret (`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`).
- Node.js (v14.x or higher) installed on your machine.
- React.js setup for running the frontend.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the instructions below to set up the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thakur-ajeetsingh-chauhan/Razorpay-Payment-Gateway-React-js.git
cd Razorpay-Payment-Gateway-React-js
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following Razorpay key:

```env
REACT_APP_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
```

Replace `your_razorpay_key_id` with the actual Razorpay key from your Razorpay account.

### 4. Run the React Application

To run the React app, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Integration Details

### Razorpay Payment Component

The payment functionality is implemented in the `Payment.js` component. This component handles the following:

1. **User Input**: Accepts payment amount from the user.
2. **Payment Order Creation**: It communicates with the backend to create a payment order using Razorpay's API.
3. **Razorpay Payment Window**: Opens the Razorpay payment window for users to complete the payment.
4. **Payment Verification**: Upon successful payment, the backend verifies the payment and updates the frontend with the result.

The component uses the Razorpay API to facilitate the transaction. When the payment is successful, the payment details are verified on the backend.

### Backend Communication

The React frontend communicates with the backend to:

- Create an order using the `create-order` API.
- Verify payment success using the `verify-payment` API.

Make sure to run the backend (Node.js) service to handle order creation and payment verification. You can find the backend setup instructions in the corresponding [Razorpay-Payment-Gateway-Backend-nodejs repository](https://github.com/thakur-ajeetsingh-chauhan/Razorpay-Payment-Gateway-Backend-nodejs).

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your Razorpay keys are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- If the Razorpay payment window doesn't open, check for errors in the browser console and ensure that the Razorpay script is loaded correctly.
